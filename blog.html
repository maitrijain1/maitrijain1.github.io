       <p> To maintain a healthy lifestyle, you need to keep eating healthy. Add more fruits and vegetables in your diet and eat less carbohydrates, high sodium and unhealthy fat. Avoid eating junk food and sweets. Avoid skipping a meal—this will only make your body crave more food the moment you resume eating.</p>

        <h3>3 STEPS TO A NATURALLY HEALTHIER YOU</h3>
        <p id="first">There are a million different advertisements nowadays, from pills that will help you drop 30 pounds quick to face wash that doesn’t have a single ingredient you’ve heard of. All in all, it’s difficult to find ways to keep your body and mind healthy, without all those nasty chemicals and artificial ingredients that make you feel wrong anyways.<br></p>
   <ol> <li><p class="naturally-healthy-p"> Treat Your Body Well If You Want to Be Healthy
We all know that dieting and a focus on eating the right foods for your body are essential to feeling like a better you. But are there certain foods that will make you feel better than others? Several studies have shown that certain foods, like leafy greens or turkey breast, make us feel significantly better than other foods. It’s because these types of foods produce chemicals in our brains like dopamine that make us feel good and sometimes even stress-free.</p></li>
<em><p id="qutes">“Health is a state of complete harmony of the body, mind, and spirit. When one is free from physical disabilities and mental distractions, the gates of the soul open.” ~B.K.S. Iyengar</p></em>
<li><p class="naturally-healthy-p"> Discover Natural Remedies<br>
You’ve probably at one point had a grandma try to convince you that your prescription cupboard could easily be replaced by a good cup of tea. But should you believe her? It’s proven that a lot of common illnesses, like the cold or flu, can be prevented and treated by at home remedies.</p></li>
<p class="naturally-healthy-p">Cures for the common cold generally involve soothing one’s throat and providing nutrients that will help get your immune system back up to fight off bugs. A popular one is Apple Cider Vinegar, which is perfect for soothing a sore throat and burning away harmful bacteria. Ginger and honey are also great combos for getting better faster. Ginger root tea is a popular choice, and a quick addition of a teaspoon of honey and a spritz of lemon juice will get you back on your feet in no time.<br>
How do you prevent a cold altogether? An obvious first step is to get lots of sleep, frequently hydrate, and treat yourself well in general. Other good ideas are natural vitamin D supplements or increasing your intake of vitamin D rich foods (fatty fish, milk, etc.).</p>
<li> <p class="naturally-healthy-p">Check Your Labels
Reviewing and understanding your nutritional information labels on the food you’re eating is extra important for living a healthy lifestyle. It can sometimes be overwhelming how many ingredients a single granola bar can have, let alone understand what each of them means. A couple of fast rules is to avoid trans fats and anything containing hydrogenated oil and you’ll start making the better decision already. If you’re sensitive to high blood pressure, you’ll want to keep away from high sodium content, with the typical cut-off being 805 milligrams.<br>
You also want to make sure the things you’re eating have a certain amount of good elements too. Look out for fiber content in carb-heavy foods as well as protein to supplement your diet the rest of the day.<br>

Overall, the key to a healthier life is to take special care of the things you’re eating, choose natural remedies over store bought pills, and actually understand what your labels are telling you. Soon enough you’ll be that much closer to a more natural li

        <h2 id="child-care">Child Care</h2>
<ol>
    <li><p class="child-care-p"> Boosting Your Child's Self-Esteem<br>

Kids start developing their sense of self as babies when they see themselves through their parents' eyes. Your tone of voice, your body language, and your every expression are absorbed by your kids. Your words and actions as a parent affect their developing self-esteem more than anything else.<br>

Praising accomplishments, however small, will make them feel proud; letting kids do things independently will make them feel capable and strong. By contrast, belittling comments or comparing a child unfavorably with another will make kids feel worthless.<br>

Avoid making loaded statements or using words as weapons. Comments like "What a stupid thing to do!" or "You act more like a baby than your little brother!" cause damage just as physical blows do.<br>

Choose your words carefully and be compassionate. Let your kids know that everyone makes mistakes and that you still love them, even when you don't love their behavior.<br></p></li>
<li><p class="child-care-p"> Catch Kids Being Good<br>

Have you ever stopped to think about how many times you react negatively to your kids in a given day? You may find yourself criticizing far more often than complimenting. How would you feel about a boss who treated you with that much negative guidance, even if it was well intentioned?<br>

The more effective approach is to catch kids doing something right: "You made your bed without being asked — that's terrific!" or "I was watching you play with your sister and you were very patient." These statements will do more to encourage good behavior over the long run than repeated scoldings.<br>

Make a point of finding something to praise every day. Be generous with rewards — your love, hugs, and compliments can work wonders and are often reward enough. Soon you will find you are "growing" more of the behavior you would like to see.<br></p></li>

<li><p class="child-care-p"> Set Limits and Be Consistent With Your Discipline<br>

Discipline is necessary in every household. The goal of discipline is to help kids choose acceptable behaviors and learn self-control. They may test the limits you establish for them, but they need those limits to grow into responsible adults.<br>

Establishing house rules helps kids understand your expectations and develop self-control. Some rules might include: no TV until homework is done, and no hitting, name-calling, or hurtful teasing allowed.<br>

You might want to have a system in place: one warning, followed by consequences such as a "time out" or loss of privileges. A common mistake parents make is failure to follow through with the consequences. You can't discipline kids for talking back one day and ignore it the next. Being consistent teaches what you expect.<br></p></li>

<li><p class="child-care-p"> Make Time for Your Kids<br>

It's often difficult for parents and kids to get together for a family meal, let alone spend quality time together. But there is probably nothing kids would like more. Get up 10 minutes earlier in the morning so you can eat breakfast with your child or leave the dishes in the sink and take a walk after dinner. Kids who aren't getting the attention they want from their parents often act out or misbehave because they're sure to be noticed that way.<br>

Many parents find it rewarding to schedule together time with their kids. Create a "special night" each week to be together and let your kids help decide how to spend the time. Look for other ways to connect — put a note or something special in your kid's lunchbox.<br>

Adolescents seem to need less undivided attention from their parents than younger kids. Because there are fewer windows of opportunity for parents and teens to get together, parents should do their best to be available when their teen does express a desire to talk or participate in family activities. Attending concerts, games, and other events with your teen communicates caring and lets you get to know more about your child and his or her friends in important ways.<br>

Don't feel guilty if you're a working parent. It is the many little things you do — making popcorn, playing cards, window shopping — that kids will remember.<br></p></li>

<li><p class="child-care-p"> Be a Good Role Model<br>

Young kids learn a lot about how to act by watching their parents. The younger they are, the more cues they take from you. Before you lash out or blow your top in front of your child, think about this: Is that how you want your child to behave when angry? Be aware that you're constantly being watched by your kids. Studies have shown that children who hit usually have a role model for aggression at home.<br>

Model the traits you wish to see in your kids: respect, friendliness, honesty, kindness, tolerance. Exhibit unselfish behavior. Do things for other people without expecting a reward. Express thanks and offer compliments. Above all, treat your kids the way you expect other people to treat you.<br></p></li>

<li><p class="child-care-p"> Make Communication a Priority<br>

You can't expect kids to do everything simply because you, as a parent, "say so." They want and deserve explanations as much as adults do. If we don't take time to explain, kids will begin to wonder about our values and motives and whether they have any basis. Parents who reason with their kids allow them to understand and learn in a nonjudgmental way.<br>

Make your expectations clear. If there is a problem, describe it, express your feelings, and invite your child to work on a solution with you. Be sure to include consequences. Make suggestions and offer choices. Be open to your child's suggestions as well. Negotiate. Kids who participate in decisions are more motivated to carry them out.<br></p></li>

<li><p class="child-care-p">Be Flexible and Willing to Adjust Your Parenting Style<br>

If you often feel "let down" by your child's behavior, perhaps you have unrealistic expectations. Parents who think in "shoulds" (for example, "My kid should be potty-trained by now") might find it helpful to read up on the matter or to talk to other parents or child development specialists.<br>

Kids' environments have an effect on their behavior, so you might be able to change that behavior by changing the environment. If you find yourself constantly saying "no" to your 2-year-old, look for ways to alter your surroundings so that fewer things are off-limits. This will cause less frustration for both of you.<br>

As your child changes, you'll gradually have to change your parenting style. Chances are, what works with your child now won't work as well in a year or two.<br>

Teens tend to look less to their parents and more to their peers for role models. But continue to provide guidance, encouragement, and appropriate discipline while allowing your teen to earn more independence. And seize every available moment to make a connection!<br></p></li>

<li><p class="child-care-p">Show That Your Love Is Unconditional<br>

As a parent, you're responsible for correcting and guiding your kids. But how you express your corrective guidance makes all the difference in how a child receives it.<br>

When you have to confront your child, avoid blaming, criticizing, or fault-finding, which undermine self-esteem and can lead to resentment. Instead, strive to nurture and encourage, even when disciplining your kids. Make sure they know that although you want and expect better next time, your love is there no matter what.<br></p></li>

<li><p class="child-care-p"> Know Your Own Needs and Limitations as a Parent<br>

Face it — you are an imperfect parent. You have strengths and weaknesses as a family leader. Recognize your abilities — "I am loving and dedicated." Vow to work on your weaknesses — "I need to be more consistent with discipline." Try to have realistic expectations for yourself, your spouse, and your kids. You don't have to have all the answers — be forgiving of yourself.<br>

And try to make parenting a manageable job. Focus on the areas that need the most attention rather than trying to address everything all at once. Admit it when you're burned out. Take time out from parenting to do things that will make you happy as a person (or as a couple).<br>

Focusing on your needs does not make you selfish. It simply means you care about your own well-being, which is another important value to model for your children.</p></li></ol>
