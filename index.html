        Instructions<br>
2 cups all-purpose flour (250g)
1 Tablespoon baking powder
1 Tablespoon granulated sugar
1 teaspoon salt
6 Tablespoons unsalted butter very cold (85g), unsalted European butter is ideal, but not required
3/4 cup whole milk (177ml)
1. For best results, chill your butter in the freezer for 10-20 minutes before beginning this recipe. It's ideal
that the butter is very cold for light, flaky, buttery biscuits.<br>
2. Preheat oven to 425F and line a cookie sheet with nonstick parchment paper. Set aside.<br>
3. Combine flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a large bowl and mix well. Set aside.<br>
4. Remove your butter from the refrigerator and either cut it into your flour mixture using a pastry cutter
or (preferred) use a box grater to shred the butter into small pieces and then add to the flour mixture
and stir.<br>
5. Cut the butter or combine the grated butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.<br>
6. Add milk, use a wooden spoon or spatula to stir until combined (don't over-work the dough).<br>
7. Transfer your biscuit dough to a well-floured surface and use your hands to gently work the dough<br>
together. If the dough is too sticky, add flour until it is manageable.<br>
8. Once the dough is cohesive, fold in half over itself and use your hands to gently flatten layers together.
Rotate the dough 90 degrees and fold in half again, repeating this step 5-6 times but taking care to notoverwork the dough.<br>
9. Use your hands (do not use a rolling pin) to flatten the dough to 1" thick and lightly dust a 2 3/4" round
biscuit cutter with flour.<br>
10. Making close cuts, press the biscuit cutter straight down into the dough and drop the biscuit onto your prepared baking sheet.<br>
11. Repeat until you have gotten as many biscuits as possible and place less than 1/2" apart on baking
sheet.<br>
12. Once you have gotten as many biscuits as possible out of the dough, gently re-work the dough to get
out another biscuit or two until you have at least 6 biscuits.<br>
13. Bake on 425F for 12 minutes or until tops are beginning to just turn lightly golden brown.<br>
14. If desired, brush with melted salted butter immediately after removing from oven. Serve warm and
enjoy.<br>

         Instructions<br>
1. Using a stand mixer or electric mixer, combine butter and sugar and beat until well-creamed.<br>
2. Ad molasses and beat until combined (mixture may look piecey, this is OK).<br>
3. Stir in egg and vanilla extract.
4. In a separate, medium-sized bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, salt, and spices.<br>
5. With mixer on low speed, gradually add dry ingredients to wet until completely combined.<br>
6. Scrape dough roughly into a ball (it will be sticky, use a spatula), wrap completely in plastic wrap and
refrigerate for at least 3 hours or overnight.<br>
7. Once dough has chilled, preheat oven to 375F (175C).<br>
8. Flour a clean surface and lightly flour the dough as well.<br>
9. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough to ¼” thickness, and use a cookie cutter (my cookie cutter for these
was about 3.5” long) to cut out shapes. Transfer to a parchment paper lined cookie sheet (or an
ungreased cookie sheet), transfer to 375F oven, and bake for 8-10 minutes.<br>
10. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for at least 5 minutes then transfer to cooling rack to cool
completely before decorating.<br>
11. Once cookies have cooled, prepare frosting and decorate.<br>

        <h2 id="recipe3">Home Made Oatmeal Cookies</h2>
        <P><em><strong>
            My mom makes oatmeal cookies every year for Christmas. Not just oatmeal cookies, she also makes double and even triple batches of  chocolate chip cookies, snickerdoodles, and sugar cookies (which is more than enough and we’re usually snacking on leftover cookies well into the New Year). But it’s the oatmeal cookies that have always been my favorite.

Instructions<br>
1. Beat butter in the bowl of a stand mixer (or using an electric beater) for about 30 seconds. Add sugars
and beat until light and fluffy (pause to scrape down sides and bottom of bowl, if needed)<br>
2. Add eggs, one at a time, beating until combined.
3. Stir in vanilla extract.<br>
4. In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, cornstarch, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.<br>
5. Gradually add flour mixture to butter mixture until completely combined. Be sure to scrape the sides
and bottom of the bowl so ingredients are well-mixed.<br>
6. Gradually stir in oats until completely combined. If using raisins or chocolate chips, stir them in at this
point.<br>
7. Chill dough in refrigerator for 30 minutes.<br>
8. Preheat oven to 375F (190C) and prepare cookie sheets by lining with parchment paper.<br>
9. Drop cookie by rounded 2-3 Tablespoon-sized ball onto parchment paper, spacing at least 2" apart.<br>
10. Bake on 375F (190C) for 10-12 (edges should be slightly browned, centers may still be slightly
underbaked but shouldn't be raw, they'll bake completely as they cool).<br>
11. Allow cookies to cool completely on cookie sheet before serving and enjoying.<br>
